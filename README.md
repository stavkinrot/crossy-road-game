# Crossy Sky
This is a simplified, sky version of the famous "Crossy Road" game I created. Instead of avoiding cars, you avoid hostile eagles and level up each time you successfully reach the top of the screen. The difficulty increases with each level!
## Usage:
- Make sure to have pygame installed.

- Please make sure you have all the files in the same folder.

- Change skins by pressing right or left in the menu screen.
